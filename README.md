# Ultimate AI Coding Assistant Ruleset

## Core Principles
- Write clean, simple, readable code with minimal lines
- Think before coding - start with 2-3 reasoning paragraphs
- Implement features using the simplest possible approach
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Test after every meaningful change

## Prompting Strategies
- "Proceed like a senior developer" when seeking high-quality implementations
- "Do not stop until complete" for comprehensive solutions
- "Start with uncertainty" to encourage thorough analysis
- "Three reasoning paragraphs" before solving problems
- "Answer in short" when brevity is needed
- "Summary of current state" to track progress factually
- "Unbiased 50/50" for comparing alternative approaches
- "Be careful with red herrings" to stay focused on relevant information
- "Only include truly necessary steps" for efficient implementations
- "Properly formed search query" for effective research

## Error Handling
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes
- Explain problems in plain English first
- Make minimal necessary changes, modifying as few lines as possible
- For strange errors, perform web searches for up-to-date information

## Documentation
- ALWAYS add helpful and explanatory comments
- NEVER delete old comments unless obviously wrong/obsolete
- Document all changes and their reasoning in comments
- Use clear, easy-to-understand language in short sentences
- Verify each feature works by providing testing instructions

## Style Guidelines
- Simple over complex
- Clean over clever
- Modular over monolithic
- Readable over condensed
- Well-documented over assumed knowledge
